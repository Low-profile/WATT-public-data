As for the turn from 69th to Belmont (or v/va), only possible to turn into correct lane if far side curb parking is not occupied. There are numerous places in the system where a bus must veer into another lane to initiate or complete a turn.

There is no such thing as Main & 92nd on the 15. That’s 96th. The turn from Main requires a swing left on Main or taking up space turning onto 96th. If there was a car waiting to turn left from 96th onto Main, the bus would need to swing left to make the right hand turn.;https://twitter.com/pax_et_bonum_/status/1044620008561602570;2018-09-25 16:09:52

And as expected, #TriMet could care or less. They don't give a f**k. Typical TriMet. The sheer amount of us ridership of TriMet that were so cheerful about it yesterday was extensive.

I suspect people in Klamath Falls and other parts of the state of Oregon fail to recognize their tax money is being used to pay public defenders, court staff, PERs etc to deal with decisions of the unelected Trimet board. Taxation without representation, as someone once said.;https://twitter.com/ChristopOConnor/status/1043541227453394946;2018-09-22 16:43:11
Missing context between Klamath falls and Trimet? Else I agree, but they get federal subsidy to police the lines ala 9/11. Hence the removal of 1st time warnings that were still arbitrary.;https://twitter.com/Zephor0s/status/1043540123017572352;2018-09-22 16:38:48

And here's the thing: Trimet doesn't know the costs.

TriMet transit police and fare enforcement officers violated Oregon's constitution by stopping, citing and arresting a David Douglas School Board member in March . Meanwhile it is still legal to urinate in the PDX streets - go figure! https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2018/09/trimets_arrest_of_latina_schoo.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter …;https://twitter.com/tucsonphr/status/1043305358830137344;2018-09-22 01:05:55
Not exactly. In this case, a TriMet road supervisor didn’t have justification to stop Ana del Rocio because there was no reasonable suspicion she hadn’t paid her fare. The judge’s ruling speaks more to random stops for fare checks. You still have to pay bus/MAX fare.;https://twitter.com/EvertonBailey/status/1043303471644954624;2018-09-22 00:58:25

This signals solid progress - but @trimet is so late to the #ditchdirtydiesel party, that it’s hard to celebrate a plan that will mean 22 more years when our neighboring states fixed this over a decade ago.https://twitter.com/robwdavis/status/1041761112054673416 …;https://twitter.com/pdxair/status/1041835529749245952;2018-09-17 23:45:21

With that said, FYI Trimet had 75 Fare Enforcement officers, and over 100+ transit police officers in 2017. They have a much more significant volume of people working TriMet and these issues still occur, and will occur because we're tackling the wrong issue in the wrong place;https://twitter.com/StumpToEmerald/status/1041833217685282816;2018-09-17 23:36:10

Moving to an electric bus fleet actually saves TriMet money over time due to lower costs to power the buses (no diesel fuel to buy!) and lower maintenance costs - so TriMet can spend those saved dollars on increased service, lower fares, etc.;https://twitter.com/climatesolution/status/1041753328806375424;2018-09-17 18:18:43

The Rose Quarter station is equally convenient to the Convention Center. It all depends on which door you're using. Is it worth slowing down the trip for EVERY MAX rider so SOME of the people attending conventions can trim thirty or forty seconds off their walking time?;https://twitter.com/darkpoole/status/1038120217170169856;2018-09-07 17:42:01
Not to say I don't believe you but I find it unlikely the train was that early. Most likely what happened is the train was so far behind schedule that you saw a train and thought it was the one you wanted and that it left early.;https://twitter.com/snickers_cube/status/1038118307855888384;2018-09-07 17:34:26

For all the @trimet #MAX light rail #fanbois calling for a #tunnel. Either raise MAX fares to $10/ride AND $25/day to park, or STFU. And advocate for higher fares. Cutting #bus service will no longer be an option. Forcing bus-only employers to pay more not an option.;https://twitter.com/sp_redelectric/status/1037791473570275328;2018-09-06 19:55:43
Also: PLEASE get rid of the NE 7th Ave station. MAX crawls *painfully* slowly through Lloyd. The stations are spaced way, way too close to each other. Prioritize lights 100% and allow MAX to get through Lloyd *twice* as quickly. And get this tunnel built as soon as possible!! :);https://twitter.com/kettlemoraine/status/1037790450646540288;2018-09-06 19:51:39

To be fair, Nick, if you've not encountered fare enforcement at 82nd Ave MAX stop, then you're not passing through it much cuz it's a regular occurrence there.

To be fair, I’ve only seen fare enforcement at two places on MAX: Around the tunnel / Goose Hollow entering downtown, and on the Banfield where all three lines converge. May be an efficiency issue if they stay on the RGB corridor.;https://twitter.com/NickCPDX/status/1037750260678815744;2018-09-06 17:11:57

As a white professional male and user of the 82nd Ave MAX stop, I’ve seen this happen repeatedly. I feel invisible as they target older Hispanic women, young black men, and the homeless.

QFT. As frustrated as I get about late buses (I have my own hashtag about bus issues), I'm more upset about the lack of a true notification system when buses break down.

As a bus driver can I ask what do you think the driver should do.

The Yellow Line was only crowded because of a special event. And thanks to MAX's very ineffective ability to scale up or down, we need better bus service - articulated buses, busways, more service to more places. It's not a luxury - it's a necessity.

5% biodiesel, 95% petrodiesel is labeled B5. Trimet uses mainly B5.

The more riders can depend on the ENTIRE system, the more they use the ENTIRE system.

"It's also important, I think, for developers, planners, community members, etc, to have some clear picture of what Trimet is trying to achieve in the eventual future. We talk about using transit more, but many don't have a mental image more detailed than ""status quo + a train""";https://twitter.com/380kmh/status/1031217757143093248;2018-08-19 16:34:07
That's reasonable, when comparing among American operators. But lest Trimet think they're already doing the best job *possible,* it's important to be clear on where they still fall short and have room to improve.;https://twitter.com/380kmh/status/1031217402829303808;2018-08-19 16:32:42

Well, developers and city planners, to be realistic. The planning efforts in Portlands suburbs are a joke. The area where I live has a low-freq commuter bus line and that's it. It's not that Trimet could supply more, but they'd be empty because of the way people are spread out.;https://twitter.com/tlockney/status/1031213074202558464;2018-08-19 16:15:30

TriMet makes $120 million a year from farebox revenue. The Rose Quarter Freeway Expansion costs $500,00,000 (+ counting). We could pay for expected farebox revenue at current level of service from now through 2022 for the amount of money the freeway widening would cost. #orpolhttps://twitter.com/bjornwarloe/status/1029609448879190016 …;https://twitter.com/nomorefreeways/status/1031200113002049536;2018-08-19 15:24:00
Simple. @trimet is NOT a transit or transportation agency, but a light rail construction and development company. And if supporting a highway means reaching a light rail goal, so be it.

Yeah but you wouldn't realize that their bags were leaking until they got on board and created a hazard for everyone else, it should just be avoided all together, if you saw the faces of the people sitting next to people with cans you would reconsider your policy, it's gross;https://twitter.com/Speedymolina92/status/1030126313225383936;2018-08-16 16:17:06

We'd be really, really interested in hearing perspectives on how well HOP works (or doesn't) for disabled folks and other vulnerable riders. Accessibility is clearly not a priority throughout the TriMet service area in other ways;https://twitter.com/ATU757pdx/status/1030104733988442114;2018-08-16 14:51:21

One final thought: HOP is indeed catching on in the region outside of TriMet, C-TRAN, and Portland Streetcar. Columbia Area Transit in Hood River has had discussions about switching to the system. Time will tell how well it works for riders.;https://twitter.com/ATU757pdx/status/1030104162908790786;2018-08-16 14:49:05
"It does seem like the switch to e-fares was motivated in large part by TriMet's desire to ""catch up"" to other agencies with e-fare systems, rather than any actual local need for a change in fare systems, but that's a symptom of a broken agency culture more than anything.";https://twitter.com/ATU757pdx/status/1030103838273896448;2018-08-16 14:47:48

Remember, if the cop, who may not want to scan your card more than once, things you don't have fare, you're boned. There is no ticket you can take to court to make it go away.

I'd be happy if @trimet just ONCE promoted a bus line, or bus service in general. But even that is just too hard for them.

I see that @trimet Orange Line has done a great job of fixing congestion along McLoughlin Boulevard. Wait, it hasn't. In fact, the ridership is exactly what the previous 31/32/33/34/99 bus ridership was. So, $1.6 billion did absolutely nothing.

. @TriMet just bought 5 electric buses for $3.4 million thanks to a federal grant. At that rate, the cost of the freeway expansion ($500 million, and growing) could buy 735 electric buses.

Another one - How about improving, expanding and further adding new buses, bus lines, transit centers, stops and building new Bus Rapid Transit lines across the metro area, as so many of us who ride TriMet demand from them, over freeway or Light Rail projects?

But TriMet is also the largest consumer of diesel in the state of Oregon- we can have a better AND cleaner transit system.;https://twitter.com/ConnollyMer/status/1026695487049682945;2018-08-07 05:04:13

If every @trimet bus purchase were just like MAX: 1. A bus would cost $2M each, just because. 2. We'd replace buses every 8 years. 3. Every bus would be larger than the prior model. 4.

Right now we have no idea if the drivers are stopping at Davis or Couch as they’re not being consistent. 12 stopped at couch, apparently the 19 went to Davis after 11am.;https://twitter.com/offthefloora/status/1023995149406199808;2018-07-30 18:14:03

My pet peeve: transit agencies referring to regular bus routes as BRT (I'm looking at you TriMet). Simple bus upgrades are the bread and butter of transit agencies, but BRT implies much more. If there isn't dedicated infrastructure is it really BRT? Or is it a just a fancy bus?;https://twitter.com/Derian_Golden/status/1023263125217456128;2018-07-28 17:45:15

Yes. Because @trimet REFUSES to invest in bus stops and high capacity buses many bus riders choose to drive rathet than stand in the hot, beating sun for up to an hour waiting for a bus with nowhere to sit, find shade, or access to water.

to be clear, congrats to TriMet for the new buses! Let's just not let those celebrating this accomplishment off the hook. It's a drop in the bucket. There's real work to be done for climate, congestion + air quality in the region. Can't be done without curbing freeway expansion.;https://twitter.com/nomorefreeways/status/1022590837153120256;2018-07-26 21:13:49
If you are experiencing congestion due to car traffic, the solution is to provide alternative options, not eliminate the alternative options. Removing that stop for the duration of the fair is a very short sighted, easy and counter-productive solution.;https://twitter.com/Trintelpathy/status/1022590398600962055;2018-07-26 21:12:04
But I'm taking about residents who want to use the bus to visit the fair. It's unfair that despite choosing to ride transit, they'd be forced to walk half a mile in the sun. That's the distance between 34th and it's next/prior stop.;https://twitter.com/Trintelpathy/status/1022589826648797184;2018-07-26 21:09:48
TriMet's 4 electric buses were paid for by a $3.4m federal grant. For the cost of @OregonDOT's $500 million Rose Quarter freeway expansion (that TriMet actively supports), TriMet could instead purchase 588 new electric buses to improve air quality across the region.

As a bus driver we get very little direct information about stop closures. Usually it’s in a notes among the dozens of other things you have ten full minutes to do before we roll. Worst is 82nd where you have some stops closed and some open all look the same. Sorry bout that;https://twitter.com/Dan_Christensen/status/1021086785118408704;2018-07-22 17:37:15

Hello Kyle! TriMet recommends that folks arrive to the platform about five before the MAX is due to depart. Once the doors are closed and the operator has their signal they are not able to open the doors up again to let additional passengers board. ^JP;https://twitter.com/trimethelp/status/1019621990204825600;2018-07-18 16:36:40

"At a @trimet listening session last month Doug Kelsey said ""we aren't in the bathroom business"" It should be the City's business though. Being able to use a toilet without having to patronize a business should be a basic expectation of public space.";https://twitter.com/Citizen_Cate/status/1019296553737936896;2018-07-17 19:03:30
Whether it’s fares or lack of public restrooms, @trimet is fast to respond with calling in the police. The message is that we just want these issues (and the people who are affected) to go away.;https://twitter.com/shoupian/status/1019295795399413761;2018-07-17 19:00:29
Worth noting that many other countries have public bathrooms as an amenity at rail stations. SF’s BART and NYC have public bathrooms at some stations. Safety is just a red herring. @trimet simply doesn’t want to have to think about the needs of less privileged people.;https://twitter.com/shoupian/status/1019295097144266752;2018-07-17 18:57:43

Theoretically yes. But with @trimet implementation of light rail, they do a very poor job to tying bus service to MAX, and emphasize park and rides.

Hi, Thanks for responding. What kind of partnerships? Is this the beginning of considering fare-free transit to help incentivize and increase @trimet transit ridership across all income brackets and demographics?

While I’m glad @trimet has introduced a reduced fare option for low-income riders, the time and labor-intensive process of getting the pass speaks to the need for more accessible processes.

So you're admitting @trimet is by choice doing NOTHING for bus riders, and intentionally discouraging bus ridership. How about we bus riders get free rides, and MAX riders pay $10/ride and $40/day to park their cars, to even out funding disparity. #FixTheBus #BusRidersMatterhttps://twitter.com/trimetalerts/status/1015303073080594432 …;https://twitter.com/sp_redelectric/status/1015304550389968896;2018-07-06 18:40:42

Hello Nicole! Thanks for the question. As long a the person boards while their fare is still valid they can ride until they get to their destination. If they need to make a transfer after the fare has expired they will need to purchase another fare before transferring. ^JP;https://twitter.com/trimethelp/status/1014988801775562752;2018-07-05 21:46:02

However actual buses are actually the ones who are able to bypass stranded incapacitated forms of transit. Cars, peds, bikes, other buses, trains, what have you.;https://twitter.com/RumpRoast/status/1014240378029920256;2018-07-03 20:12:04
In fact, light rail is the most problematic and issue-riddled form of transit - just behind Trolleybuses, since trolleybuses are a regular ole bus bound with light rails. So you incur the light rail issues while also having bus issues, and then it's own unique problems too.;https://twitter.com/RumpRoast/status/1014240124098375680;2018-07-03 20:11:03

But even that is riddled with issues surrounding the cantenary, as they have archaic telearms rising from the roof of the bus to the power lines. And these have constant issues on Trolleybuses that must be removed from the cantenary lines from cantenary/power issues.;https://twitter.com/RumpRoast/status/1014239476418150400;2018-07-03 20:08:29

Stick to legitimate buses, and don't try to yank light rails into buses like that.

Yikes.;https://twitter.com/RumpRoast/status/1014200845502537728;2018-07-03 17:34:59

Trolleybuses require the cantenary line and poles in order to be used. And, if a Trolleybus happens to disconnect from their lines, they're just as stuck as a light rail vehicle.;https://twitter.com/RumpRoast/status/1014200388499542016;2018-07-03 17:33:10

Trolleybuses are literally a direct combo of light rail into a bus. It is the most purposely bind of transit forms anyone has ever convinced and done ever. Buses are buses, and not forced to proprietary corridors. Light rails are stuck in proprietary corridors.;https://twitter.com/RumpRoast/status/1014199982344159232;2018-07-03 17:31:33

Biking won't bring up ridership on TriMet either by the way. The only way ridership could begin to go back upward for them, specifically on buses, is if they commit back to their ridership, ridership input and focus upon buses while recognizing that their light rail addiction is;https://twitter.com/RumpRoast/status/1013522372064710656;2018-07-01 20:38:58

You want to solve transit issues?

"Logistically most people would rather bike than walk simply because they're lazy and don't want to ""expend that kind of energy"", yet are for some reason willing to pretend biking takes less energy than walking.

There in lies exact issue. You want advocate for growing the city? That means gentrification, and with TriMet in charge, that means more Light rails, as MAX is the gentrification machine here.

Good luck with selling people on that 1-2mi walk to the bus on a dirt shoulder. The anti-bike attitude is what keeps trimet from being able to fill a bus every 15min in the outers.

If your requirement is that an existing stop literally NEVER can be removed, then I guess I sort of agree but I think that’s ridiculous. Blue picks up at Baseline/170th, just south of Jenkins at Beaverton Creek, and just south of Jenkins at Millikan.

That’s not what you claimed. You claimed ridership DROPPED, not that actuals fell short of predictions. Like, in comes train, down goes ridership in absolute terms.

I rode the 12, 45, 92, 94, 95, 96, until TriMet's lack of reliability, its uncaring attitude and its constant cutbacks forced me to drive.;https://twitter.com/sp_redelectric/status/1008011752708063235;2018-06-16 15:41:44

The racist that stabbed and killed 2 men on Trimet in Portland was a Hillary supporter. He was disgusted by a 14 yr old on the train wearing a hijab and some nice white men stepped in to help the girl. Those men are dead. The killer is racist & hates Trump. There’s one example;https://twitter.com/ov_girl/status/1008009186230202368;2018-06-16 15:31:32
But 48, 20, and 57 still exist on the west side. I can still take 77 out to Gresham, 12 to Parkrose, etc. In short, I would expect some adjustments but would look at the Orange Line for how life will likely change.

OK, I had an inkling this was based on feeling and no facts. I would expect that SOME buses will either disappear or be modified. 94 should probably go.

You can also count on routes like the 1, 38, 39, 43, 44 and 45 will be truncated, and likely will no longer go downtown. TriMet already plans to reroute the 56 to Sylvan (not downtown) and the 45 to serve Beaverton, not Tigard (see the Southwest Service Enhancement Plan).;https://twitter.com/sp_redelectric/status/1007859464857268224;2018-06-16 05:36:36
You know TriMet won't publicly say that until the very end. I've lived here for every single MAX project. Does the 5 still run? Nope. Does the 33 still go downtown? Nope. The 57 as a single line? Nope. Mark my words. The 12, 94, and 96 lines will NOT exist.;https://twitter.com/sp_redelectric/status/1007858981040107520;2018-06-16 05:34:40

Riding the #trimet here in #Portland is strangely #anxiety triggering for me. But I still try to ride it when I can. If I've learned anything from my new job, it's to get outside your comfort zone more often. It helps you in strange, unexplainable ways. #MentalHealthAwareness;https://twitter.com/GreenJollyPeter/status/1006335089158938627;2018-06-12 00:39:16

The problem is that your trimet tracking app didn't reflect that. There was another green line max that went through a little before the 7:44a, and that was on time.

I think the bottom line in Erik’s tweet is LACK OF ADEQUATE TRAINING which leads to unsafe maneuvering in 40’ buses It’s a structural defect because Trimet won’t pay for operators to learn routes.

Good morning Allen! The technology of the app does not allow for single tickets to be converted into day tickets or monthly passes (similar to paper tickets). TriMet is looking at using a different mobile ticket app in the future to help alleviate this. ^JP;https://twitter.com/trimethelp/status/1005105879249707013;2018-06-08 15:14:50
For sure! Years ago we offered a Youth summer pass, but that was before the price of the Youth monthly pass was lowered. Hope you have a good day!! ^JP;https://twitter.com/trimethelp/status/1005104889859461120;2018-06-08 15:10:54
"The @trimet way... ""There's a major public event, with little on-site parking? Instead of using our buses to get people there, let's shortline the route so people can't use the bus.""

So are car drivers just 'accomodated'? Why don't we rip out the car lanes when we put in rail, instead of making token bike/ped ways. (And why don't planners truly analyze HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GET TO THE TRAIN?!?!?! - it's not with cars!);https://twitter.com/CLeonard46/status/1005103154524872705;2018-06-08 15:04:00

"@CLeonard46 the problem remains that none of these projects have requirements for quality bikeways. there's no set-aside or financial obligation for anything but the rail.. so that's where the focus goes & everything else is only ""accommodated""";https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Maus/status/1005101232627699713;2018-06-08 14:56:22
