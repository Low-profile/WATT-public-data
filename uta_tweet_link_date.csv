The train is scheduled to depart Stadium at 2:28 pm. Do you recall where on the platform you were when you were running, waving, and calling? We don't see anyone doing that in the playback, and we certainly want to make sure the train operator was watching out for passengers.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1046145312119771138;2018-09-29 21:10:53
Wasn’t it scheduled to leave at 2:29?;https://twitter.com/StevenSeril/status/1046143448028393472;2018-09-29 21:03:29
I appreciate you looking into that. My wife is still very upset that we ran & waved/called to the driver but he drove off anyway, & that saddens me too.;https://twitter.com/StevenSeril/status/1046143200140963840;2018-09-29 21:02:29
Oh shoot! We checked the playback from station cameras, and the SB train departed Stadium at 2:28:43 pm, right on time. We recommend being at a station at least 5-7 minutes early, just to be safe.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1046142116018229248;2018-09-29 20:58:11

@RideUTA Your previous Redline train at Stadium left a minute early at 2:28 & left me & my wife behind. She was looking forward to our event today. Disappointed.;https://twitter.com/StevenSeril/status/1046140598661472256;2018-09-29 20:52:09

Terrific question! Yes, please tap off whenever exiting a bus or train, and then tap back on when you board another bus or train.

@RideUTA I noticed that the outlet prongs beneath the tables on FrontRunner are getting loose enough that sometimes, the power cable isn't making a connection, and as such, laptops/phones/etc. aren't charging their battery.

I have to rely on Uber or lyft for the latter part of my trip due to this constant delay where the bus sits for 5-10 minutes. It's almost pointless for me to purchase a monthly pass.pic.twitter.com/bqfA2mWB9z;https://twitter.com/anahuac213/status/1045399894356254721;2018-09-27 19:48:52

Noted, but why is it always late. It daily sits for 5-10 minutes at the hub before departing. It makes the connection with the blue line 10% of the time. This is really unacceptable.;https://twitter.com/anahuac213/status/1045394031830654976;2018-09-27 19:25:34

From January-June 2018, people riding UTA instead of driving saved a net total 1,091,000 lbs of criteria air pollutants from entering our air. That's the equivalent weight of 40 school buses.

Thanks for your response!

BONUS 3/2: Most of the FR system is single-track, with double-tracking limited to each station plus four more sidings for trains to pass each other. The schedule has dictated trains pass each other at the same stations and sidings for some time, but that is subject to change.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1045324693086130177;2018-09-27 14:50:02
...to our system-wide schedule changes, which typically occur each year in April, August and December. This maintains transfer reliability.

As we continue implementing PTC, our trains become less capable of making up time from delays due to PTC-related constraints. We are testing a new schedule for FrontRunner this Sunday, but because FR connects with so many routes, we will limit future FR schedule changes... 1/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1045323234999193600;2018-09-27 14:44:15

@RideUTA Lots of “train meetups” recently, causing timing delays. If this is the new normal, can the schedules be changed to show these as new longer times (for customer planning)?

Sorry, we weren't able to get your message and forward this request in time. The reason your train was proceeding slowly was due to an issue with a crossing gate south of Woods Cross.

Let me guess. The train jumped the tracks, hit a car, got back on the tracks, then waited for a response. </sarcasm> Why do people blame UTA for this? It's the drivers of the vehicles!

Because the 21 runs every 15 minutes on a tight schedule, it cannot hold for transfers at stations beyond its scheduled departure time. This is our policy for all routes on 15-minute frequency, but other routes may be able to hold for trains seen pulling into the station.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1044241865321721856;2018-09-24 15:07:16

Can someone turn down the AC on the blue line at 4:56 am train leaving from Draper Town Center? Its nice in the afternoons but at that time in the morning, it feels like a walk in refrigerator.

@RideUTA What a joke. Once again I arrive 10 minutes early to my stop at central station and the Front Runner is already gone. Now I have to wait another hour.

Thanks. I caught it. But can we change he departure time to 6:35 or have an implicitly 5 min wait, so when it's delay like this won't happen again. Also since it's 616 front runner by name, that's what the route was originally added for , it should sync better with the FR train;https://twitter.com/sinistan/status/1042954673513127936;2018-09-21 01:52:25

Understandable. It’s frustrating when I’m relying on transportation from Frontrunner to the Green Line so it is out of my control. It wasn’t like this until the past few weeks. It has increased in frequency. At this point I am resolved to walk a mile to work when I see it leave.;https://twitter.com/TheCleverReader/status/1042054976481026048;2018-09-18 14:17:21
We typically advise people to plan on transfers of at least 7-8 minutes, and we work on our schedules to facilitate that as best we can at major hubs. Unfortunately, we can't plan this much time for each transfer at every hub, but we'll see what we can do here.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1042053172594974720;2018-09-18 14:10:11
I understand that but at this point the timing needs to be evaluated to see if 5 mins is effective. I will continue to notate each time I’ve had to watch it pull away. The worst is when you watch someone standing there pushing the button to get on and it just leaves.;https://twitter.com/TheCleverReader/status/1042051566960881666;2018-09-18 14:03:48

@RideUTA I am and have been a regular rider for over 15 years. In the Salt Lake Valley your service is second to none. Not so much the same in Utah Valley.

We aren't saying you're at fault - only that we will check the bus' header info at that time. For future trips, you can safely hop on an 831 bus that arrives at this stop in order to take the 841 to get to the Orem Station.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1041728516801392640;2018-09-17 16:40:07

Talked with another bus driver and apparently 831 turns into 841 at my stop. They didn’t change it until they stopped, and I didn’t see my right bus number when they pulled up.

We'll investigate to see if there were any issues with the bus' header displaying the wrong route number. The NB 831 does convert to the WB 841 at that stop.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1041726504999247872;2018-09-17 16:32:07
Thanks - how can we get a better idea of arrival times to a station? Those don't appear to be available online, via mobile or in the trains themselves. For those that start at one end of the route and finish at the other, it's nice to know our expected ETA to a station.;https://twitter.com/karenmogridge/status/1041724571458498560;2018-09-17 16:24:26
831 stopped by but not 841. I have been waiting a half hour now. They may have changed their number later, which is incredibly misleading. It’s now set me off by an hour.;https://twitter.com/tbthefuture/status/1041723980770668545;2018-09-17 16:22:05

@RideUTA Help! I just got off the train at the Layton station at 7:05, and realized I left my hoodie. I know this sounds dumb but it’s my favorite hoodie!

This plan may change. There will be a supervisor, in a vest, at Decker Lake observing the crowds at the end of the concert. You may communicate with them, as well, about your trip to Lehi. If TRAX needs to hold the NB Green at 11:24, they will communicate with FR about transfers.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1040388877368930304;2018-09-13 23:56:52
Yes, NB Green at 11:24 pm will arrive at Central Pointe at, approximately, 11:35 pm. SB Blue departs at 11:36 pm (TRAX will hold this train for the NB Green) and arrive at 11:45 pm at Murray Central. SB FR departs at 11:51 pm, but will watch for transfers from the SB Blue line.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1040388101514948609;2018-09-13 23:53:47
Seriously. I send compliments when they’re deserved but this “redesigned train meet” thing is getting old. Again I am sitting at the Salt Lake Central station looking at a “NB FR 10-15 Minute delay” sign.

Okay! I've communicated with TRAX and FR. It sounds like the best we can do is get you from NB Green to SB Blue at Central Pointe, then from SB Blue to SB FR at Murray Central that's scheduled to depart at 11:51pm.

The reason for your train's delay coming into North Temple is due to a car that was stalled on the tracks in Centerville, causing both your train and a NB train to hold until it could get cleared from the tracks.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1040252004008976384;2018-09-13 14:52:59

I’m not sure what you’re referring to. Sorry. I was just talking generally about UTA, mostly the TRAX and Frontrunner. They’ve been delayed 20-30 minutes most mornings the past few weeks.

@KSL5TV #KSL @KUTV2News #2NewsAM @fox13 #Fox13 a #RideUTA bus flew past me (had walker, #ADA needs) and did not stop, @RideUTA is using every excuse possible to get out of responsibility and making the situation right. @gpugmire @RideUTA #epicfail;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/1037787491535732736;2018-09-06 19:39:53
Okay! I will add this comment to the report that will be sent to administration and our ADA compliance officer. Would you like to be contacted about this?;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1037787284035260416;2018-09-06 19:39:04
Traffic was very good at the time. What is 20-30 seconds tops more to help one with #ADA needs? Or other courtesies, he did this out of spite and I will have to escalate, the GPS timestamps are fast by as much as 2-3 minutes possibly;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/1037785928327094272;2018-09-06 19:33:41
Appropriate make-goods are required and appropriate modifications to policy to honor the bus cards inside the buses you had in 1995 and 1996 are required, you must give periodic updates on the progress of that. I will be going to media outlets.;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/1037784786381590528;2018-09-06 19:29:08
I don’t blame them for the buses. Traffic can’t be helped. I get frustrated by the frontrunner and TRAX though.;https://twitter.com/aj_pittam/status/1037784560325591041;2018-09-06 19:28:14
This is a pick-up issue, not a drop-off, Thew card read 'We don't want anyone to be late, but we won't leave anyone behind' or words closee to it. That was put on buses when the first with #ADA features came, the 95s or 96s, and I still expect that to be honored.;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/1037784303034200064;2018-09-06 19:27:13

The NB 850 is scheduled to depart at 11:14 am and GPS shows it passing at 11:16:43 am. According to the drop-off policy, the bus operator is only required to make stops that a customer on their bus needs to get off at. Administration may review this policy, if you'd like.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1037781373610803200;2018-09-06 19:15:35
@RideUTA According to your schedule the 33 departs from WVC @12:55 but for some reason it usually departs 10 minutes late everyday. Have there been changes to schedule?

Due to the 15 minute frequency of route 850, the next SB 850 bus was a few minutes behind the delayed 850 bus that was instructed to do drop offs only. If you'd like, I can forward your comments, and my findings, to administration to have the drop-off policy reviewed.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1037778945817681921;2018-09-06 19:05:56

That is still no excuse, the #ADA requires a shadow vehicle if something like that happens, and there was none.

I was told that heavy passenger load and multiple ADA wheelchair passenger loads between Lehi and University Place Station caused the delay. The GPS for the next bus, that was scheduled at your stop at 11:22 am, shows it arriving at 11:23:14 am. (2/2);https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1037772889100111872;2018-09-06 18:41:52
Okay! The GPS shows that the SB 850, scheduled at 11:09 am, passed your stop at 11:17:19 am (8 minutes delayed). I was told by dispatch that the next 850 was catching up to the delayed bus, therefore, the one you saw pass your stop was instructed to do drop-offs only.

Yes that was the stop. The schedule says 1109 from 1230 N 500W and it takes a couple minutes to get down, a NB 850 passed going the other way like I usually see there just before so the bus flew by ON TIME;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/1037765063396868096;2018-09-06 18:10:46

It is 300 North 500 West southbound in Provo, 850 leaves 1230 N at 1109 and this one arrived after that but on time as normal but again just flew past and switched lanes at 200 N to make the left at 100 N.

Exactly. I like the idea of not having to sit in traffic....but if it only runs once or twice an hour, it's a lot of time spending waiting and riding on a train.;https://twitter.com/huutransuperman/status/1037416505686683648;2018-09-05 19:05:43

Thanks @RideUTA and route 834 for always being late. I’m only 30min late for work. This is the reason why I’d rather take my car.;https://twitter.com/RuthArce9/status/1036969746447515648;2018-09-04 13:30:28
You're welcome! We're sure such footage would show its fair share of frowns, but it's a nice consolation that another UVX bus should arrive in as few as 6 minutes!;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1036969620295622657;2018-09-04 13:29:58
Ok, it would be interesting to watch the footage of people's look of surprise/frustration as the bus pulls away though. Thanks for the explanation!;https://twitter.com/leap4emily/status/1036968393553764352;2018-09-04 13:25:05
Thanks for adding this info. We'll send your comments to the supervisor.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1036965837717090306;2018-09-04 13:14:56
Yep. Nearly happened last week, but the driver saw me at the last minute. Hence my waving both hands as the driver was approaching (and passing) me today.;https://twitter.com/loydo38/status/1036965084507987968;2018-09-04 13:11:56
We'll forward your request to our bus dispatch, but it would likely have to wait 5 minutes or more and therefore may not be able to hold that long. We can't guarantee it, but we hope you and all other UVU transfers can make it.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1036964640037720065;2018-09-04 13:10:10
@RideUTA Frontrunner is a bit behind coming into Orem SB. Can you ask the 841 to wait 1-2 min before leaving?;https://twitter.com/curtiskoelling/status/1036963400306241536;2018-09-04 13:05:15
Oh no! We'll investigate this and inform the driver's supervisor. Just to confirm, is this the SB 232 scheduled at your stop at 6:32 a.m.?;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1036963080238968832;2018-09-04 13:03:58
@RideUTA I didn't rush out of my house to walk 1.5 miles to the Trax station.;https://twitter.com/loydo38/status/1036959710841204737;2018-09-04 12:50:35
@RideUTA can you tell the 232 driver who drove right past me at the SB 8132 S stop to next time look for the guy standing right next to the sign and waving both hands trying to get her attention?;https://twitter.com/loydo38/status/1036959394175414273;2018-09-04 12:49:20
Yes, because UVX buses run so frequently, they are required to leave each station as soon as the schedule allows to avoid congestion and delays.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1036959386638475264;2018-09-04 12:49:18
Minor delays of about 5 mins have occurred recently because of brief technical issues, usually on one train, that cause other trains on the single-track system to be delayed. We are monitoring these and working to make technical improvements and possible schedule adjustments.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1036958654690467841;2018-09-04 12:46:23
@RideUTA Are the UVX buses supposed to pull away from the Orem FR station as people are walking up to it from the train? I barely made it on just now but people walking just feet behind me didn’t. Last week I watched it pull away as we were tapping off the train and heading over.;https://twitter.com/leap4emily/status/1036957887354920961;2018-09-04 12:43:20
@RideUTA why is the morning train, 6:36 at AF late so often?;https://twitter.com/math4al/status/1036957347506081793;2018-09-04 12:41:12
Hi Nicholas, what's your destination? Most of our TRAX lines run almost as late on a Sunday schedule as they do on weekdays.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1036833314747899904;2018-09-04 04:28:20
@rideuta why are the trax trains stopping early tonight? People work this late that need to trains. You are a public company that provides transportation. You should not have special hours on holidays. I now have to walk 10 blocks to get home.;https://twitter.com/Snicrstod/status/1036824095600652288;2018-09-04 03:51:42

Thanks, we'll definitely share your feedback with planners.

A train every 2 hours from like 8-8 or 8-6 might be beneficial for students and maybe a few other commuters. I know I would take FR on Sunday if it ran! I like to visit friends in Ogden and having FR run on Sundays would be amazing even if it was a limited schedule.;https://twitter.com/UtahTransitFan/status/1036780703717834752;2018-09-04 00:59:16

@RideUTA I had a question about route 11. I catch the 11 on B St. & 6th Ave towards downtown. Is there construction or a lot of passengers to drop off between where it starts & where it picks me up? I ask because I'm trying to understand why it's late almost every day I take it;https://twitter.com/JSPtheSecond/status/1035173560359112705;2018-08-30 14:33:04

Or adjust the schedule and decrease frequency! At least so there’s some reliability in the schedule. 10-15 min delays on a service that only comes thirty minutes makes it difficult to schedule.

We're also testing vertical bike racks in cars to improve bike capacity and clearance.

We did the best we could with limited funding. It was critical that we secured the rail alignment and station space when it was available in the 1990s-2000s, but there was no way we could affording double track along the entire alignment.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1034231169112518656;2018-08-28 00:08:20

@RideUTA why are all the busses/trains late now? Ever since the last change day every bus has been at least 10 mins late. Trains as well. Today the train was 15 mins late.

Trust us...nobody wants double track more than the UTA folks covering Twitter right now :). It's one of the organization's long-term goals, but it is very expensive and will require significant funding and public support.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1034229977573556224;2018-08-28 00:03:36

We understand your frustration. Today's delays are caused by weather-related issues. We've also been implementing a new federally required safety system, and as a result trains are forced to travel more slowly. This can create delays.

@RideUTA Once again, the Southbound train is running slow again! I am on the SB FrontRunner that is supposed to arrive in Provo at 4:43. This means that the SB 805 bus is going to be leaving at 4:53.

Why don't you hire more conductors and hosts instead of making all these unnecessary schedule changes? Here is an idea instead of blowing 50 million$on changing the name to transit authority of utah... keep the name you have and hire more train operators and fix what you have;https://twitter.com/randalcraig4/status/1030510198379569152;2018-08-17 17:42:31

Both of these factors are temporary - we anticipate construction to end in October, and the 850 will no longer serve the transit center as it will also be moved. We know it's a bit of a ziggy-zaggy transfer, but we hope to improve that as soon as we can.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1030111655152308224;2018-08-16 15:18:51
We understand your concern and appreciate your feedback. Some of this is due to the ongoing UVX construction, but it is also due to the nature of the 850 route, which briefly runs east to get to the transit center while UVX heads west. 1/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1030110536053260288;2018-08-16 15:14:24

The difficulty would lie in the route. The most direct route, Sardine Canyon, doesn't have any tracks, so you're talking hundreds of millions to install.

That’s what the driver told me when we were passing that stop. I asked when I boarded if that was stop was open and I told it was. If I had been told it was actually closed I could’ve gotten off before my stop. The problem is I ended up in Provo when I had no intention of going;https://twitter.com/abbyysaurus/status/1029401114074992640;2018-08-14 16:15:25

Ideally, one should be able to track the location of UVX buses the same way they do with all buses, but we can see they aren't showing on the tracker right now.

Yes - while FrontRunner has allowed construction to fence off the south platform entrance at South Jordan, when that blockade is used is at the discretion of the construction company in order to keep people safely out of its construction zone, so we will not be removing it.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1029041937834229763;2018-08-13 16:28:11

OK, a minor text issue on my end indicated it wasn't on detour, but it is. Heading east, the route should continue on 2700 W. down to 4700 S., turn left toward 2200 W. and then turn left again toward SLCC. This is due to construction and is scheduled to end at the end of the day.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1029020772482863104;2018-08-13 15:04:05

If we can move Utah Valley toward a more transit-friendly future, that addresses a lot of other quality of life problems that will only get worse as the population grows.;https://twitter.com/jrpjrpjrp/status/1027562441129914369;2018-08-09 14:29:11

Why aren’t the bus drivers dropping passengers off at the drop off zone?Especially when they are running late and the Frontrunner is about to leave.

I hoped it would be better with a marketing deal between the Royals and UTA but something like including UTA service with your RSL/Royals ticket is unlikely. It sure would make it easier to get in and out of matches if they did, well and running later routes on gamedays.;https://twitter.com/f4denz/status/1025849596126392321;2018-08-04 21:02:57

@RideUTA so today the train was 7 minutes late, AND has NO AC! 5 years ago Frontrunner was appalled if they heard they consistently ran 5 mins late. The best response I've had from u these days is :yeah, we know. We only post if we're 10 mins late. DO BETTER.;https://twitter.com/JaredUnsell/status/1024810045714849792;2018-08-02 00:12:09
I attended an information session in June and was told directly by a UTA representative that their current fleet of engines is already operating at capacity, and that in order to add extra cars they would have to upgrade the engines.

I agree in principle, but the execution is flawed. It's like a cattle car today. Nowhere to sit and people still keep getting on. Air conditioning can't keep up. Slower loading and unloading. Engines can't carry additional cars, so the frequency needs to increase.;https://twitter.com/markreviewstwit/status/1024802395077767171;2018-08-01 23:41:45

Fail. @rideuta Today is miserable for regular commuters as predicted. Standing room only, slower loading and unloading, air conditioner can't keep up...I love the idea, but current infrastructure can't handle the load. Engines can't handle more cars. Time to increase frequency!;https://twitter.com/markreviewstwit/status/1024801673460383744;2018-08-01 23:38:53

I don't want to be a bother, @RideUTA, but the conductor on the special Green Line taking us to North Temple said we're waiting 10-15 minutes for a few more Red Line trains. It's 12:07 now.

@RideUTA Bus driver on Route 220 did not know the detour for the parade this morning. Seems like there might have been a communication breakdown in telling drivers about the planned detours.;https://twitter.com/rayhowze1/status/1021785048050089985;2018-07-24 15:51:53

I would think so. Nobody would want to park downtown on a day like this because traffic will be a nightmare with the parade. But it’s the total opposite, and they only run one car on Sundays so everyone is packed into the train like sardines.;https://twitter.com/GobertOrGoHome/status/1021720041048301568;2018-07-24 11:33:35

That is incorrect. I would have seen it otherwise. This brings up another issue: why was the Blue Line so delayed? I would have anticipated with UTA’s myriad of issues that the severe delays would have been generally rectified by now.;https://twitter.com/HoneyBadger1875/status/1021538862189797377;2018-07-23 23:33:38
I cannot speak as to what the CS agent said, but I used the playback from the cameras at the platform to determine what time the train departed the station, and playback shows it was at 5:09 pm. I used GPS history to determine when the Blue Line arrived, which was also at 5:09pm.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1021538371980722178;2018-07-23 23:31:41

I take 8.52 am shuttle. Many of my friends take route 850 as it is waiting to depart and 864 comes late mostly. It is because 863 gets converted over to 864, and 863 gets stuck on its way back from adobe way etc. so 864 is always late;https://twitter.com/ChebuRakshu/status/1019608468058091520;2018-07-18 15:42:56

Probably a two-step process. 1) Eliminate fares to boost ridership, 2) use boosted ridership to justify route expansion. Would have to calculate the savings of each vehicle trip removed from the road and offer a portion of that to improve service.;https://twitter.com/elforesto/status/1017508958750330881;2018-07-12 20:40:14

Will there be anything adjusted to try and avoid the consistent train meet delays (or at least make it seem like they're planned for)? It seems like the train that's supposed to leave draper northbound at 3:54pm is consistently late (among other trains).;https://twitter.com/jnielson01/status/1017493342718812160;2018-07-12 19:38:11

Due to a single track in some areas, trains are designated to meet at specific locations where there is double tracking. A delay, even a minor one, can affect these meets, therefore, they get re-designated to a different location, which delays the train that's instructed to hold.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1017216675706531843;2018-07-12 01:18:49

That's not a nice thing to say, from the employee.

My wife timed it from the car from when the train stopped, it was 52 seconds. Your next northbound just showed so I timed it in my phone from when it stopped (not even doors open). 51 seconds.

We can confirm that the northbound train scheduled to depart American Fork at 8:06 a.m. did so at 8:06:32 a.m. Watches or phones may be behind our system-wide clock, so we always recommend arriving to a station at least 5 minutes early to make sure you can catch the train.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1017050466138689548;2018-07-11 14:18:21

Thanks for following up! This is a terrific example of why we recommend being on the platform 5-7 minutes early. In this situation, your clock was reading a different time than our clocks, and being on a platform a few minutes early ensures you're able to catch your train.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1013949054664003585;2018-07-03 00:54:27

I'm sorry but I have to disagree. I checked my phone after it started rolling away, it was 6:13. As for suggesting to arrive 5-7 minutes early to accommodate for the train possibly arriving early is not fair to the riders, especially when we rely on the schedules and timliness;https://twitter.com/dailymagical/status/1013946702405832709;2018-07-03 00:45:06

We can understand your frustration, however we checked the cameras for Lehi Station and both NB and SB trains arrived at 6:14 and departed at 6:15, which is the scheduled departure time for both. To be safe, we always recommend being on the platform 5-7 mins early.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1013943544661278720;2018-07-03 00:32:33

@RideUTA I'm so upset right now! The frontrunner came in at 6:13 and left almost immediately as I approached. It's not suppose to depart until 6:16! Now I have to wait 45 minutes for the next train from Lehi to Murray!

However, if you tweet us your request to hold that bus, we can reach out and sometimes it will hold longer for transferring passengers.";https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1011979141623754753;2018-06-27 14:26:43
Thank you for responding. The 841 usually leaves the station at 6:12 and the train pulls in at 6:14 perhaps the driver could wait around a couple minutes as a bandaid?;https://twitter.com/curtiskoelling/status/1011978041872924672;2018-06-27 14:22:21

Yes, the 2X seems to have departed almost two minutes prior to the NB FR's arrival at SL Central. We advise this route to wait for the train excepting major delays, and we will forward this information to the operator's supervisor.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1011969710445998080;2018-06-27 13:49:15
The departed 7:23 didn’t wait for its only passengers and is driving empty then. Lol it usually waits for the FR passengers before departing.;https://twitter.com/Motiveelite/status/1011967588505739264;2018-06-27 13:40:49
The 2X at the station should be the one scheduled to depart SL Central at 7:40 a.m., in about 2 minutes. The previous 2X departed at 7:23 a.m. and is on time.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1011967161034735616;2018-06-27 13:39:07

Recent delays affecting trips like this one are mostly due to a new safety system required by federal regulations and implemented in April. We are working to resolve these delays now and are examining possible schedule adjustments.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1011965892320641024;2018-06-27 13:34:04
@RideUTA The Frontrunner (SB 6:05am Orem) Has been running late for weeks and is now missing the 841 more often than not. I would catch an earlier Frontrunner from Layton but there isn't one. When is this going to be resolved? Getting to work late is a problem.;https://twitter.com/curtiskoelling/status/1011964510804983808;2018-06-27 13:28:35
We'll forward your feedback to our TRAX maintenance department. Currently, the HVAC is programmed to automatically adjust to either a hot or cold setting depending on the temperature, and TRAX drivers are unable to manually adjust it during a trip.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1011941818966126592;2018-06-27 11:58:25
Is there a certain time and station you're seeing that differs from the public schedule? The website should show the train schedule, and if trains depart these stations at different times, it is likely a delay in the system.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1011937607742304257;2018-06-27 11:41:41

I have no desire to argue about it with you, I was just sharing what has been my experience since 2008 when Rio Tinto opened. I have taken trax to almost every home match for a decade and rarely do I see any attempt to make it easier for those who use the system.;https://twitter.com/f4denz/status/1010363282656395264;2018-06-23 03:25:52
I keep hearing about this but my experience as a passenger has been different almost after every match, almost always only 2 cars (almost always packed). I respect you all have a job to do, but if the service was more reliable more people would use it.;https://twitter.com/f4denz/status/1010362762050953216;2018-06-23 03:23:48
you do, and more than once I have been dumped off those later trains at the Central Point station at 21st South, with no trains going further north. There are almost always trains after matches, just a matter of them stopping there and dumping off people;https://twitter.com/f4denz/status/1010362076789817349;2018-06-23 03:21:05

I have not been impressed with @RideUTA support of #RSL from day one. I watch them run better coverage for Bees and Jazz all the time, from extra trains to extra cars, but RSL has always been treated a bit worse (my opinion).;https://twitter.com/f4denz/status/1010352619322163200;2018-06-23 02:43:30
That’s a total bummer there for those needing or wanting to use @RideUTA One 10:50 train would likely resolve that issue and possibly give more fans the trax option;https://twitter.com/VWPeteW/status/1010351623233626112;2018-06-23 02:39:33

@RideUTA how about a cheap tablet with a cellular connection, just showing Transit tracker? $15/month data plan, $200 for the tablet, couple hundred for the tablet housing.;https://twitter.com/adjacent_cow/status/1010222980952031232;2018-06-22 18:08:22
@RideUTA Riders really care about trouble reliability. (Big theme at TRB last year). I can consult Transit Tracker when the Trax signs are BS--not everyone can.;https://twitter.com/adjacent_cow/status/1010222528717918208;2018-06-22 18:06:34
Can we fix that? Because it looks incompetent when reality conflicts with station announcements. And that lowers trust in UTA as a whole.;https://twitter.com/adjacent_cow/status/1010221821617057792;2018-06-22 18:03:45

That all depends on how much your time is worth. When transfer windows don't line up and UTA is too stubborn to fix them, the value of the time lost exceeds any money I might save.;https://twitter.com/dyoung1993/status/1009850306962702336;2018-06-21 17:27:29

As minor delays arise, we've had to adjust train meets, causing some trains to run on delays of 10 mins or more.

Many of the delays you are experiencing are due to Positive Train Control, a federally required safety system we implemented two months ago. It forces reduced speeds in certain areas, and while we adjusted the schedule for this, it has caused some minor delays. 1/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1008712047788527616;2018-06-18 14:04:27

Again? why delay the on time train? The ppl on the train that's late are *already* late. For the most part, being 5 min late vs 10 min late, you've already missed your transfer.

We had an NB FR train, earlier, that had mechanical issues & was swapped at Murray Central, departing with minor delays. Due to both tracks at Murray Central being occupied, an SB FR train held at Salt Lake Central until the NB train arrived, which later delayed another NB train.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1007410775743451136;2018-06-14 23:53:40
Thanks. I appreciate it. I also don’t know why this is already a PTC issue per the timeline for deployment shows July as service time for PTC. So it appears someone jumped the gun. My 2 cents.

Agreed. If this is because of PTC (which isn’t required until the end of 2019), how about the project team taking a step back and evaluating that their plan is full of flaws instead of steamrolling ahead with no regard to the passengers.;https://twitter.com/MrEdCV/status/1007405777236054016;2018-06-14 23:33:48
Yes, the delays that occur or grow because of holds and re-designated train meets are due to single tracks and additional restrictions from Positive Train Control that were recently placed in April.

Glad @RideUTA has Trax running on time. Only downside is when Frontrunner isn't and you see your train pull away 30 feet from the door.;https://twitter.com/Cssmit142Smith/status/1003992628319289345;2018-06-05 13:31:10
Correct. While we try to schedule feasible transfers at major hubs, we cannot accommodate transfers of 7 or more minutes for the many trip possibilities at these stations.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1003990164656533504;2018-06-05 13:21:23
But as far as FR goes, that can mean taking an FB train that a half an hour earlier, just to make a TRAX transfer.;https://twitter.com/HikeAtAllCosts/status/1003988509579882496;2018-06-05 13:14:48
The SB FR-to-SB Red Line transfer at MC has only a 3-minute window that is easily disrupted by minor delays.

Well may I suggest 5 or 10 more minutes away from the train's scheduled time to allow for minor train delays like today. 5 min would have meant being ontime;https://twitter.com/jefflbarton/status/1001843004422868994;2018-05-30 15:09:20
We usually have three days a year when we change the schedules - April, August and December. Sometimes the changes are minor, and sometimes, like in April, many more changes are made. I don't believe we have an exact date or details yet, but updates will come before the next one!;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1001842537236221953;2018-05-30 15:07:28

If feasible, letting us know 10 minutes or more in advance allows us to get the word out. We appreciate our drivers' unsolicited holds, and we expect them to be courteous, but we hold them accountable to their schedules and can't guarantee they will be able to wait.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1001840692082159617;2018-05-30 15:00:08

@RideUTA I am on the SB FR to Provo that is supposed to arrive in Provo at 5:43 pm. I need to be able to catch the 805 SB FrontRunner that leaves Provo at 5:53. Please hold the 805 SB bus that leaves at 5:53. Thank you;https://twitter.com/DrGTMarie/status/1001598818331250689;2018-05-29 22:59:01

Thank you for following up. The Green Line is scheduled to arrive at 4:24 pm, which only gives a 3 minute window, where we recommend scheduling your trip with a 7-10 minute window for transfers to give yourself enough time to get from one mode to the other safely. (1/2);https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1001596075051044864;2018-05-29 22:48:07
If it's a schedule thing then they need to be reworked. It's unacceptable for a transfer to pull out as a train pulls in making it virtually impossible for people to make by mere seconds. Thank you for your prompt reply;https://twitter.com/holycowww/status/1001595088101834752;2018-05-29 22:44:12
The driver that refuses to wait is scheduled to leave at 4:27. If Trax is behind I understand, but this is a consistent occurrence. There is next to no chance to catch this bus unless you SPRINT the instance the train stops and even then the driver pulls out without waiting.;https://twitter.com/holycowww/status/1001595000810074118;2018-05-29 22:43:51

The physical day passes actually need to be punched by a bus operator the day you travel, so you can ask any bus operator at your starting station to punch it before boarding TRAX. Or, if you'd rather, you can purchase day passes on the UTA GoRide app and activate them yourself.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1001514078966288385;2018-05-29 17:22:18

This caused the train to restart it's departure process and the door loop was activated, again, to secure all doors, which is why the doors would still not open when the passengers went over to the correct boarding side and why you could not open the doors from the inside. (2/2);https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1000534115547058179;2018-05-27 00:28:16
When the passengers attempted to open the doors after the train began to depart, the train lost propulsion and came to a stop, which is a safety function. Forcing the doors open will interrupt the electrical circuit that has secured each door, this is called a door loop. (1/2);https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/1000533074659151872;2018-05-27 00:24:08

Hi Bob, I checked with our planner. We don't have immediate plans to improve the 630. We are working on a five-year plan and will include improvements to the 630 for further study, but implementation will depend on factors like funding, ridership, demand, etc.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/999322269250936833;2018-05-23 16:12:50
"... in other words, it's presented as ""we'd rather have more people be less late"", but really, the difference is 100 people 30 minutes late or 300 people 30 minutes late.

since lots of those 300 people are going to have to meet busses, which aren't going to wait 7 minutes, thus making most of those people 30+ minutes late. The 100 people that were 20 minutes late were likely already going to be 30 minutes late by the time they xfer to bus ...;https://twitter.com/mupi2k/status/999321572073598976;2018-05-23 16:10:03
I agree that having the 'one late train' becoming severely delayed isn't ideal (though with a 30 minute run time, it's unlikely to be more than 30 minutes delayed anyway...) But if 100 people are 20 minutes late, versus 300 people 7 minutes late, which is worse? Especially ...;https://twitter.com/mupi2k/status/999321396118339584;2018-05-23 16:09:21

Are you referring to the Woods Cross stop? There is a train on approach to that station, but it had to wait momentarily in the Centerville area due to an issue with the track.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/998563698712174592;2018-05-21 13:58:32

This is typically due to train meets with trains that are delayed going southbound. Sometimes an issue that delays a single train will affect multiple trains due to single-track meets, and we are monitoring these delays and their causes for future improvements.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/998562050757492738;2018-05-21 13:51:59
I still don't understand how a train that leaves Orem earlier than before is always delayed now or why we ended up waiting for 3 SB trains between Orem and Draper?;https://twitter.com/Tartanfan65/status/998560553692942336;2018-05-21 13:46:03
It is actually on approach from South Jordan. It is delayed almost 10 minutes, but the reason the signs indicate that is because of an issue with that train's GPS system. We are working to get it fixed.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/998559561874321408;2018-05-21 13:42:06

It appears that your bus was late to the point it had to alter its route and wasn't able to service your stop. We'll investigate why this happened and report it to the operator's supervisor. Also note that the 520 is scheduled at that stop at 6:03 a.m., not 6:05 a.m.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/998541971017883648;2018-05-21 12:32:12

Today, there was a crossing protection, which means your train was instructed to slow down at a street crossing to 15 mph due to a broken crossing gate, then it had a train meet later on. We were still gathering information when your train arrived at Salt Lake Central. (2/2);https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/997656331774582784;2018-05-19 01:52:59
Okay! We found that on Mon, Wed & Thurs, your train was delayed after holding for delayed southbound trains at re-designated meeting points, which we call train meets. When one train gets delayed, it may cause a domino effect on other trains, which FR strives to maintain. (1/2);https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/997654681072689162;2018-05-19 01:46:26

Are you referring to a specific NB FR train? If so, what time and location, please? There are different factors that could cause a delay. We usually post the reason of the delay with the alerts.

@RideUTA any chance you could manage time more effectively? Maybe if the train arrives 5 min early it shouldn’t leave 3 min early if someone is running desperately to catch it? I’d make it if I didn’t have to tap my monthly pass all the time, for some reason. #FoodForThought;https://twitter.com/johnrt89/status/997613049417687040;2018-05-18 23:01:00
It's definitely up to you to board a different car or train, if that makes you feel safe. UTA must abide by state and federal gun laws. You may want to contact your local legislative representative.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/997606421989613568;2018-05-18 22:34:40

Police wouldn't help. They'd bring more guns onto the train and wouldn't even ask him to leave;https://twitter.com/sarah_jwh/status/997601994268344322;2018-05-18 22:17:04
The presence of a gun on the train makes me feel unsafe but there's nothing you would do to prevent him from riding armed. The best I can do is try to be sure to get in a different car than him;https://twitter.com/sarah_jwh/status/997601779943604224;2018-05-18 22:16:13

@RideUTA The SB Frontrunner in Utah County is delayed, holding at AF when we should be close to Orem by now. Any chance the 841 bus could hold for us? It leaves about 7:42 usually but the train is unlikely to make that connection on time. Thanks!;https://twitter.com/leap4emily/status/996383299894362112;2018-05-15 13:34:25

Sigh. Per usual the @RideUTA schedule leaving SL Central is messed up. Unless the 205 left at 930 and not 935, it's almost 15 minutes late. (And if it left that early ... screw that.) But hey. Not like I have a meeting this morning and the bus only runs once an hour or anything.;https://twitter.com/vegawriters/status/995692670092697601;2018-05-13 15:50:06

Yeah but the shuttle van can take even longer. And just Monday the train was on time but they still had a van anyway, and those hosts did nit a good job notifying everyone,some weren't even aware and had started getting on busses. So that shuttle process can be problematic;https://twitter.com/sinistan/status/994368061296623616;2018-05-10 00:06:34
Usually, for major delays, shuttle vans are prepared to transport passengers to Pleasant View from Ogden. Your train is about 1-2 minutes delayed and will proceed normally.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/994365320776290304;2018-05-09 23:55:41

Ridership determines the #of cars used on our TRAX lines. The train that you are on, usually, has 4 cars during the university's Fall and Spring sessions, however, ridership drops during the Summer session and is accommodated.

That train departed SB from Draper only 4 minutes delayed, so a lot of things can cause that: heavy passenger loads, having to go slow in some areas for safety reasons...but I did contact bus dispatch and the 805 in Provo will wait for transfers from FrontRunner. :);https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/993994595305447424;2018-05-08 23:22:33

It is not scheduled at exact 30-minute service all day long. It is scheduled at that stop at 8:13 a.m., then 8:47 a.m. and 9:17 a.m. At that point it assumes 1-hour midday service.

If it is scheduled to be on that corner :13 on the hour then that would mean it was 5-7 minutes late everyday, and yesterday it was 8 minutes late since it arrived at 8:21;https://twitter.com/JSPtheSecond/status/993868476161798144;2018-05-08 15:01:24

Just to make sure, you mean the 11 bus toward SL Central as it stops on B Street near 6th Avenue (300 North)? The actual scheduled departure for that bus from that stop is at 8:13 a.m., so you may have missed it.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/993865968546967553;2018-05-08 14:51:26

It slightly changes from 3:19 p.m. to 3:47, 4:17, 4:47 ... until 5:49 p.m. It then continues 30-minute service every :19 and :49 of the hour, just as it was in the morning, until the last departure at 8:19 p.m.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/993855028992659456;2018-05-08 14:07:58

While I have my own personal opinion, just so you understand... the proposed switch swaps the 35M for the 35, the idea being that riders won't have to walk as far from their stop. This is more a service change from express to local rather than a cut. Hmu in a DM for more.;https://twitter.com/Joshontrains/status/993831389253390336;2018-05-08 12:34:02

After viewing the camera footage, it appears there was about a 7-minute window for passengers on the late train, which arrived at 9 a.m., to transfer to this TRAX train.

Thanks for checking.;https://twitter.com/KateIswell/status/991889787693887488;2018-05-03 03:58:48
Ok. Perhaps the app was wrong. It’s just so frustrating to think you’re going to make it and watch it drive away two min before you think it is supposed to.;https://twitter.com/KateIswell/status/991889706806738944;2018-05-03 03:58:29
According to our schedule, the SB 209 was to depart 212 S 900 E at, approximately, 4:13 pm. GPS shows that it departed at 4:11 pm. This is not a Time Stop, which requires bus operators to depart at the scheduled time. The times for bus stops in between Time Points are estimated.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/991888947902058496;2018-05-03 03:55:28
It's possible that the transit (3rd party) app was incorrect. We're a bit confused, though. In the image of route 209's PDF schedule you sent us, the time 4:06 pm was circled for the stop on South Temple & E St.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/991888038467784706;2018-05-03 03:51:51

Because the FAREPAY discount on TRAX is not quite as much as it is for local bus, using FAREPAY to board TRAX costs $2.00 and includes any transfers to and from local bus routes. Riding the bus using FAREPAY costs $1.50 without any TRAX transfers.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/991361481601179656;2018-05-01 16:59:30

Yes, there is one 953 trip in the morning that leaves Midvale Fort Union at 6:43 a.m. and goes up the canyon, and one trip in the afternoon that leaves Alta at 5:05 p.m. Even if you stay within the valley, the fare to ride this route is still the standard ski fare of $4.50.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/991339626228002816;2018-05-01 15:32:39

It happens frequently at stop 807005. There is a road construction sign near the stop. I was told by a driver that if I waited where I've seen it stop short frequently to allow a rider to exit, that the bus would not stop to allow me to ride.;https://twitter.com/UnholiestJedi/status/989513964152176641;2018-04-26 14:38:07
Can you tell us at which stop this happened? There are few instances in which this is normal - at end-of-line stops where the bus needs to wait, or at stops occupied by another vehicle or obstacle. Otherwise, operators are expected to pull up to the stop.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/989511140135796736;2018-04-26 14:26:54

Yes! The group pass is $15, and covers fare for up to four riders traveling together on FR, TRAX, and local bus. You will need to purchase it from a ticket vending machine on the day of travel and is active after 8:30 a.m. until midnight.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/989492810977042434;2018-04-26 13:14:04
Would it be cheaper to buy a group pass?;https://twitter.com/jrod_gman/status/989489801236639744;2018-04-26 13:02:07
You wouldn't have to buy a ticket for yourself with an Eco Pass, of course, but regular FR fare for that trip would be $4.30 one way, $8.60 round-trip, and $17.20 for two round-trip tickets.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/989489527701016576;2018-04-26 13:01:01
@RideUTA need to buy 2 FR tix from Clearfield to N Temple. I have an eco pass. Is it like $8 per ticket round trip?;https://twitter.com/jrod_gman/status/989487415147429888;2018-04-26 12:52:38
If there is an incident that forces us to suspend service at one or multiple stations, we send extra buses to transport customers to those stations. This is called a bus bridge, and it works the same way for both FR and TRAX.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/989461329596633088;2018-04-26 11:08:58
So what exactly is a bus bridge? The dispatch guy mentioned that a lot.;https://twitter.com/S2N_LORDFIST/status/989381173339197442;2018-04-26 05:50:28

Okay, The SB Red Line train that you're on is scheduled to arrive at Murray Central at 7:24 pm and the SB FR train is scheduled to depart Murray Central at 7:21 pm.

Not sure if this is what you're asking, but TRAX cars can be separated because they can power themselves. FR cars are dependent on a single locomotive. #frontrunner10;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/988862424492240901;2018-04-24 19:29:08

I realize that people bike, but how many people do you displace if you have two bike cars per train trip? Doesn't that seem a bit problematic if people want to ride and can't because finding a seat is difficult?

.landi3337 asked about bike car capacity. One-third to one-half of our trains have two bike cars, we don't have plans to add more at this time.

... at either station, forcing the bus to hold for late trains will cause delays throughout the trip and possibly the next for other customers.

I stand corrected. Kudos to today's driver for getting us there just in time. Clearly though, if this route is this consistently late, there needs to be some adjustments somewhere.

Thank you. We understand missed connections are frustrating, so we looked into this. Your train did arrive behind schedule at 9:01 a.m., and we typically can't hold TRAX like we can some other modes.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/988445838648266754;2018-04-23 15:53:47
The schedule stated we would get to SL central at 855. The blue line was supposed to leave at 858 heading to draper. We pulled up a bit late at 859. As we were all walking towards the sole blue line train, he pulled away.;https://twitter.com/eodenaj7643/status/988443112686080000;2018-04-23 15:42:57

Yet again disappointed in @RideUTA’s lack of FR/Trax schedule coordination. FR pulled up to central station. As we got off & approached the Trax train, it pulls out with no one on, leaving us to wait 10 min until the next one.

Speeds are determined on a federal level, so we don’t have much control over trip time. That said, we are examining the long-term possibility of electrifying the trains, which would make them lighter and able to accelerate/decelerate faster for shorter trip times.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/987010143459205120;2018-04-19 16:48:50

What I'm getting at is that there should be some pushback on some of the speed guidelines. Most of the FR rte is a straight line & commuter rail is no where near as heavy & hard to stop as a mile long freight train. When time cost to travel exceeds conveniece, you'll lose riders.;https://twitter.com/russell_fawcett/status/987002302203494400;2018-04-19 16:17:41

FR & TRAX connections were, definitely, a priority for these recent changes. These connections at Murray Central with the 15 min transfers from an NB Red Line TRAX to an SB FR assures those connections, even if the NB Red Line (that arrive at :06 & :36) runs a few min delayed.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/986778679710797824;2018-04-19 01:29:05
Well yes, that’s my point. Why is the schedule set such that a popular transfer requires either risking missing the FR or having a long wait? I would think coordinating schedules at the FR-Trax hubs would be priority.;https://twitter.com/ste_ph_en32/status/986770219891769344;2018-04-19 00:55:28

Apologies, we misunderstood your post and thought you were departing from the University Medical Station. That being said, to plan a trip with a transfer that is less than 5 min is, logistically, not possible. We suggest that you plan, at least, 5-7 min in between your transfers.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/986764713987014656;2018-04-19 00:33:35

We see that the SB Red Line trains are scheduled to arrive at Murray Central at :24 & :54, and the SB FR trains are scheduled to depart, during peak times, at :21 & :51. Is it possible for you to catch the Red Line trains that depart from Medical at :49/:19 and arrive at :24/:54?;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/986753325378035712;2018-04-18 23:48:20
The issue I run into is the red line to University Medical that is scheduled to arrive at Murray Central at :52 and :22, the same time that the Southbound Frontrunner is scheduled to depart. If the Trax are off schedule at all, you miss the connection;https://twitter.com/ste_ph_en32/status/986750774804819968;2018-04-18 23:38:12
Thank you for sharing your feedback! What does your trip look like, and could you, please, explain what trains are off schedule? We would like to forward this information to our planners!

@RideUTA The Trax-FR connection at Murray Central is very frequently off schedule, causing people to miss their connections. If the trains can’t stay on schedule, there needs to be more buffer time. How was this not a priority on change day?;https://twitter.com/ste_ph_en32/status/986742351249817600;2018-04-18 23:04:43
Thank you for sharing your feedback! Due to requirement by the Federal Rail Administration (FRA) in implementing Positive Train Control (PTC), FrontRunner will slightly take more time to travel between Provo and Ogden. Here is more information about PTC: https://www.rideuta.com/news/2018/03/UTA-Implements-Positive-Train-Control …;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/986734800697511936;2018-04-18 22:34:43
@RideUTA so did the FRA institute the new rail speeds? Honestly the changes are terrible and make using the frontrunner infeasible, especially if you have to wait 15 minutes for a Trax after you get to a stop. An increase to a 2 HR commute is not acceptable.;https://twitter.com/russell_fawcett/status/986731126302556160;2018-04-18 22:20:07

We try to schedule transfers this way, but with the vast number of connections it is impossible to make transfers of 5+ minutes at each station. This is one of those transfers - you are referring to the NB FR & SB Red Line that both leave at the :09 and :39 of every hour, right?;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/986627000860315648;2018-04-18 15:26:22
@RideUTA I know the trains are supposedly timed to accommodate each other but it really sucks that the only way to catch the first south redline trax is to sprint from frontrunner. Would an additional 30 seconds at the Murry Central stop really throw off the schedule that much?;https://twitter.com/AngryGinger85/status/986624581942292480;2018-04-18 15:16:45

Helping customers is our priority, and this matter is being sent to planners to see what can be improved.

This is because both the Green Line and the 217 run at a 15-minute frequency throughout the day, so at all trip times the 217 is scheduled to depart at the same time the Green Line arrives.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/984406919925387265;2018-04-12 12:24:33

Yes, that bus was in need of an unscheduled operator swap, which delayed it enough that it had to cut out the north portion of its route in order to stay on time. We apologize for this inconvenience. The next SB 470 should depart the Ogden Station at 8:04 a.m. and is on time.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/984067285240483840;2018-04-11 13:54:58

@RideUTA I wanted to thank the NB frontrunner drivers this morning who were kind in not leaving me behind as I was running to catch the train—I was still on schedule. Many thanks for their act of kindness. Hopefully other drivers can follow their example.;https://twitter.com/SitneyC/status/984062127261417473;2018-04-11 13:34:28

Yes, due to adjustments that had to be made during last night's delay incident, the single-level comet car did not make it back in time as part of your train's consist of cars.

@RideUTA Per Utah Code 41-6a-706.5, drivers need to give bikes 3 ft. Pretty sure that applies to buses.

The people on the disabled train will be taken to Layton. At this time we are approximating the departure time NB will be about 9:30 pm, making their arrival time at Ogden 10:00 pm.

It most likely won't delay the train getting to Farmington NB, but delays may be possible north from there. We are working on getting the disabled train towed so that other trains can continue their journey.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983904646786965505;2018-04-11 03:08:42
We are towing the disabled train at this time, which will allow other trains to pass. The next NB train will be at Layton at approximately 9:30 pm.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983904251310215168;2018-04-11 03:07:08

No that's not what happened, other train was already there or pulling out. The employee or hosts are the ones that usually cause unnecessary delays. Also I watched a host earlier just walk by numerous ppl laying down in comet car, and not say anything.

Yeah. It does make it harder for those without farepay cards or space on their phones for the app. It's not as big a problem using Trax and Frontrunner, since they have a ticket kiosk, but it will be on the bus, since your options will be: the app, a farepay card, or cash. :/;https://twitter.com/ChalisaYoung/status/983862498171355136;2018-04-11 00:21:13
I have one and I like it, but when I travel with others not so equipped it has been convenient for me to tap my credit card for one of us and the farepay card for the other. My concern is that it adds a hurdle to ridership that was, for a time, wonderfully absent.;https://twitter.com/BoBo_Of_ID/status/983861330389057536;2018-04-11 00:16:35
If a train is waiting for more than a minute at a station, then it isn't waiting needlessly. Usually, the train is waiting for a meet with another train due to the single tracks in some areas. But there's a myriad of reasons why a train may be held at a station.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983859349989875713;2018-04-11 00:08:42
It was on time yesterday too, until they decided to start delaying departure from each station after salt lake. Tell them to stop waiting extra minutes at each stop needlessly.

You can give our Lost & Found Office a call today at 801-287-4664.

...a transfer by using the Ticket Vending Machines when you arrive at your FR station. It is your choice to do either of these things now, but currently the HIVE Pass cannot be used as a transfer to FR through the UTA GoRide app. 2/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983704231285809154;2018-04-10 13:52:19
We will forward this to our app developers as a suggestion to be reviewed. Currently, you are able to purchase a FR ticket on the app before you begin your trip, and it will be valid as a transfer on buses and TRAX before you hop on FR. Or, you may use your HIVE Pass as... 1/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983703900753711104;2018-04-10 13:51:00

The SB 217 is scheduled to depart at the same time the Green Line train towards the airport arrives at Power Station. We understand this makes for a hit-or-miss transfer, and we'll see if it can be improved.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983693165902417920;2018-04-10 13:08:21

Thank you for the help. This is what I show on the weekday schedule from https://www.rideuta.com/Rider-Tools/Schedules-and-Maps/750-FrontRunner … and selecting Maps Schedule. Is this an incorrect version? It is labelled as 750schedule_Apr2018x.pdf.pic.twitter.com/dB6iIFA0W9;https://twitter.com/BradenTolman/status/983385462831071238;2018-04-09 16:45:39
This is incorrect. We are downloading the correct schedule from our website, but we will also alert FR about the schedule you see at the station. To confirm, southbound trains arrive at WX at 8:50, 9:20, 10:20, 11:20 a.m. and every hour thereafter until 3:50 p.m.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983383656461979648;2018-04-09 16:38:28
The schedule I downloaded from the website and the schedule posted at the stop show the southbound schedule at Woods Cross as 9:50, 10:50, 11:20, 11:50. Can you confirm the schedule please?;https://twitter.com/BradenTolman/status/983382202510553089;2018-04-09 16:32:42
There is no SB train scheduled at Woods Cross at 9:50 a.m. At that stop, hourly southbound service begins with the 9:20 a.m. trip, so the next train would be scheduled at 10:20 a.m.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983380942587858946;2018-04-09 16:27:41
@RideUTA SB Frontrunner did not show up at WC at 9:50 in accordance with new schedule. I had to wait until 10:17. What gives?;https://twitter.com/BradenTolman/status/983380049805041664;2018-04-09 16:24:08

We checked the GPS history of your trip. The delayed FR train arrived at Orem 9 minutes behind schedule, which did cause you to miss an 830 bus that left at 8:11 a.m. The next 830 you caught departed on time at 8:27 a.m.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983374381295468544;2018-04-09 16:01:37
Yes, a SB train arrives at Provo and dwells there for about 34 minutes and shares the platform with a NB train for a few minutes before the NB train is scheduled to leave the station. This is a new development due to the change in schedule.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983372880472887296;2018-04-09 15:55:39

Redline to university. last week (and for as long as I can remember before that) it was scheduled for 9:09 and today the train left at 9:07 immediately after a Greenline.

@RideUTA any reason that the redline train today at central pointe didn’t follow the old or new schedule for departure times? This is t the first time there’s been some serious problem with it being late or leaving early. 0/10 I hate the train;https://twitter.com/casey_morley/status/983361816423256065;2018-04-09 15:11:41

@RideUTA is off to a great start with their new schedules. Frontrunner was 15 min late then the bu driver sat and talked with a pal for another 15 minutes instead of driving us where we need to go so I end up 20 min late for work.

We'll forward your feedback about the announcements. It may also be due to the volume settings in your specific train, in which case we'll contact FR about your train now. Just to confirm, are you on the SB train that departed SL Central at 6:09 a.m.?;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983325131970961408;2018-04-09 12:45:55

That is fine. But it’s a bit of an overshoot, everybody on the bus this morning thought it was a bit ridiculous. I may start walking up the hill and I think I can beat the bus on foot now.........;https://twitter.com/crashandburnv/status/983323555692658690;2018-04-09 12:39:39
The change is principally meant to increase the FR-to-500 transfer window. Previously, a train delayed by just a few minutes coming into North Temple could cause passengers transferring to the 500 to miss it. The new schedule makes transfers possible even when trains are late.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983322342284840961;2018-04-09 12:34:50
Then you should re-evaluate the schedule. You are making a lot of us workers at the Capitol late to our jobs. By almost 10 minutes more than before. The trains arrive at nearly the same time as before, maybe a minute or 2 difference at most, why did you change the 500 by so much?;https://twitter.com/crashandburnv/status/983320318956613632;2018-04-09 12:26:47
What may have been meant by the 500 leaving after the trains come is that the 500 will wait past its scheduled departure for delayed trains. 2/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983319817913593856;2018-04-09 12:24:48
Like all of our standard bus routes, the 500 may not leave a time point station like North Temple early. While its purpose is principally taking passengers to the Capitol, it must adhere to the schedule for customers trying to catch it while it is en route. 1/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983319489113722881;2018-04-09 12:23:30

@RideUTA this morning on the 500 at north temple both trains had come and gone, all passengers were on buses and the train platform was empty. But bus operator sat there for 8 or 9 more minutes before leaving at the 6:11 time. I was told they would leave after both trains came?;https://twitter.com/crashandburnv/status/983317528783896576;2018-04-09 12:15:42

Hmm, we are looking at ways to improve the fare structure. I think people are accustomed to transfers and that might be a hard switch, especially if they’re used to the FAREPAY discount AND a free transfer, but I can pass your recommendation along!;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/983020480473874433;2018-04-08 16:35:20
@RideUTA Have you ever thought of decreasing the bus fare from $2.50 with transfers given out to $1.25 and no longer issuing transfers? It would get a lot more people to ride and drivers won't need to wait for someone pulling out expired or invalid transfers from their pocket.;https://twitter.com/bobk1701/status/983012667169189888;2018-04-08 16:04:18

Late?! I was there at 10:01 going on 10:02. You're looking at someone getting hurt (thought safety was first priority) I was about to knock the door on a STOPPED train. And he took off.

Ugh, I am so sorry - it's awful to just miss a train. If the train left at 10:03, it departed right on time. Unfortunately we can't wait for passengers arriving late, as the process of unlocking doors, letting riders on, re-securing doors, etc creates a significant delay.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/982111703331516423;2018-04-06 04:24:11

A bus may change routes at its end of line, but it depends on the route and trip time. In the case of the 54, it remains as a 54 bus traveling back and forth from Murray Central to 5600 West throughout the day.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/981890040220536832;2018-04-05 13:43:22
Yes, the bike car has been moved so it can be closer to the train host, who will always be at the door specified for people with disabilities. This makes it easier for the train host to both assist cyclists board and check on the bikes at each station.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/981886662560174085;2018-04-05 13:29:57

We are aware of an issue affecting payments through the FAREPAY site and are working on a solution. As for the charge, you may give our customer service a call at 801-743-3882, option #5.

@RideUTA will there be a southbound train? Layton?;https://twitter.com/lascoff13/status/981162805142302721;2018-04-03 13:33:36
We will inform our bus department of the FR delay and your request to hold the #3, but we can't guarantee that it will. As it runs every half-hour, it is more likely to hold, but it may not be able to for more than a few minutes. We hope you make it!;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/981162546228088832;2018-04-03 13:32:34

@rideuta Any chance you could have the #3 bus hold at SL Central until those of us on the SB frontrunner get there? The #3 only comes every 30 minutes. It would be delightful if this temporary schedule adjustment could be put place until the FR gets back on schedule. Thanks!;https://twitter.com/dje_twit/status/981161770004856832;2018-04-03 13:29:29

What I'm saying. Is UTA needs to realize that over 20,000 people attend those sessions, and provide more service to accommodate those people in attendance.;https://twitter.com/LordZeloxy/status/980301974045278208;2018-04-01 04:32:58
UTA accommodates from general conference in the salt lake county area. But screws over those of us that live in the Davis, Weber, and Utah county areas. At least run your trains every 30 minutes like a normal day on general conference Saturday.;https://twitter.com/LordZeloxy/status/980294285336571904;2018-04-01 04:02:25
The thing is, we did plan. We ride frontrunner every day on a commute to work. But today was a special event General Conference.The session is supposed to end at 7:30 but ended at 7:50.

. @RideUTA Like I said, my commute will almost double, and instead of being about 2x longer, it will be nearly 4x. & I'm still going to have a largely unpleasant walk.

Yes, the SB 821 begins hourly departures from Provo at 7:20 am, with a SB FR arriving at 7:13 am to make that transfer. The 7:49 a.m. 821 trip is cancelled because we will start hourly service a half-hour later in the morning. All trips have thus shifted one half hour.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/978362857753645056;2018-03-26 20:07:37
"I am lucky, I *COULD* take the 838 instead. but the 821 is about .6 miles, the 838 is over a mile to hike, along a path that's partly along streets with no sidewalk; that additional .5 mile means 10-15min longer, and I'm already technically late every day";https://twitter.com/mupi2k/status/978361400660705287;2018-03-26 20:01:49
"I take the 821; it leaves Provo at ~7:50 ( 7:49? in the sched). That trip is being dropped, but there's now one at 7:20. So I can wait until 8:20, or take the 7:20 bus, which means catching FR 34 minutes earlier at 6:30 for about 2 hrs total time. Or, drive for ~35min.";https://twitter.com/mupi2k/status/978359814760747008;2018-03-26 19:55:31

Work on South Temple too. Drivers go 45-50 mph in a 30. It's a joke! People are forced to run across the street in designated crosswalks. SLC going backwards on public safety. Make street safety a priority. Slow down traffic. South Temple is not/should not be high volume. @slcpd;https://twitter.com/derrickSLC/status/976497576886247424;2018-03-21 16:35:39

Most of the upcoming changes are due to the shift in FR's schedule, which has to be adjusted in accordance with positive train control. Adjusting either FR or the 526 is unlikely to occur before change day in April, but we'll monitor ridership & feedback for future improvements.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/976098431386243072;2018-03-20 14:09:35

Currently, we don't have any late FR trains, except some minor delays of a couple minutes, which can happen for any number of reasons. Some recent delays were caused by mechanical issues on the trains or track, such as a crossing gate, as well as train meets on the single track.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/976095081659817984;2018-03-20 13:56:17
Yes, those times are correct. We referred to the 526's last afternoon trip earlier, and the times we gave you this morning were based on those transfers. The reason this earlier transfer is longer is due to the 1-hour midday trips on FR. We'll loop in planners on your feedback.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/976093474893201409;2018-03-20 13:49:54
@RideUTA Here is your posted times for 526 afternoon. 526 arrives at Draper Frontrunner 3:16PM, soonest Northbound Frontrunner leaves 3:54PM. So that looks like 30+ minute wait to me. Again, look at your published upcoming changes.;https://twitter.com/CarverjJeff/status/976091443587563520;2018-03-20 13:41:49

In the case of the 526's new schedule, 30 minutes is an exaggeration. The transfer to SB FR is 19 mins, to NB FR is 8 mins and to TRAX is 10 mins. While the 19-minute transfer to SB FR is longer, scheduling the 526 to come later would jeopardize the NB FR transfer window. 1/2;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/976082065207758848;2018-03-20 13:04:33

We understand wanting to get home from work as soon as possible. Checking the new 526 schedule it looks like the last one arrives at Draper at 5:16pm. A SB FR departs Draper at 5:35pm, a NB departs at 5:24pm, and Blue Line departs at 5:26pm, so transfers are still available.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/975880062946902019;2018-03-19 23:41:52
@RideUTA With the upcoming changes, bus 526 in the afternoon will no longer have any correlation to the train schedule. Riders have been informed that this was a UTA oversight but cannot be corrected until August. C'mon, tell us you can do better than that! #UTA526;https://twitter.com/tomkofford/status/975876312324689920;2018-03-19 23:26:58

Hmmm, this changes often and can depend on the time of day. We may have data on this that will take some time to find, if you wish, but for now my best guess is the comet car or the bike car.

Yes. Since you're on is an unscheduled event train, we calculated that you would arrive at Courthouse at, approximately, 9:37 pm.

Not dangerous. When a substation's power level drops, it feeds off of another substation. Our TRAX Operators call into dispatch when they see the flashing blue light and our maintenance of way crews are sent, immediately. Sometimes, a substation will reset itself.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/974098615160524802;2018-03-15 01:43:02

If punctuality is important to you, forget public transit. Frontrunner was 10 minutes late Monday, 30 on Tuesday, and is already running late again Wednesday.

Hi John. We are unable to hold FR, but we will be making adjustments to FR and the 830 in April. This means the first SB 830 will arrive at the Provo station at 5:42 a.m., with FR departing at 5:47 a.m., adding a couple minutes to the transfer.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/973891653378478080;2018-03-14 12:00:38
@RideUTA I always have to run from the 830 bus to the frontrunner that leaves at 5:50am. Almost every morning. Could you guys just delay the frontrunner by five minutes?

This is one delayed arrival we didn't tweet, as the train was not late departing WX or even departing NT, and we didn't catch it. We don't tweet delays for individual buses, but we can look into the 209 scheduled at 7:19 and inform that bus driver's supervisor.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/973565888430473216;2018-03-13 14:26:10

My apologies - I misunderstood which train you were on. Unfortunately we cannot request that bus to hold for as long as it will take for your train to arrive. The next 613 you can catch will depart Ogden at 9:00 a.m.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/973563508028780544;2018-03-13 14:16:42

Slightly may be a little subjective or unspecific - your train was 4 minutes delayed. Though there was still a 4-minute window, we requested the bus to hold - did you make it?;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/973560025955397632;2018-03-13 14:02:52
"The Frontrunner I am currently on was supposed to be in Ogden at 7:52AM, but we are currently sitting at the Layton Station waiting for a southbound train.

Thanks, that helped us identify your bus. Unfortunately, that bus had a mechanical issue related to its engine, and we had to replace it with a new bus. This caused part of its NB trip to be missed.

Thanks for clarifying. The older cars on the Blue Line are actually not compatible with the newer Siemens S70 cars on the Red and Green Line.

Most likely. Or maybe it slows down and crawls through the stops but doesn’t stop to let people on? When driving is more convenient and faster than the train, I can’t justify riding.;https://twitter.com/itsSmiff/status/971921983133724672;2018-03-09 01:33:52
I totally agree, but you would need a separate track, right? Express trains in other cities are lifesavers.;https://twitter.com/StaircaseWhitt/status/971921080859295745;2018-03-09 01:30:17
Just talked to my wife about this. Wish there was some sort of an “express Trax train.” One that only really stopped at a few of the big stops. Like Frontrunner...but for Trax;https://twitter.com/itsSmiff/status/971920845630091264;2018-03-09 01:29:21

"Utah's governor is against spending money to rebrand @rideUTA, saying the transit agency is ""not as tarnished"" as some would believe — but he's all for restructuring it to ""make sure that functions better, more transparent, more open"" #utpolhttps://trib.al/STwcPJ5";https://twitter.com/sltrib/status/971910898603495424;2018-03-09 00:49:50
Of course! Okay, we located your stop & confirmed its delay, today. There were no reports explaining why it was delayed, therefore, we will file this information & direct it to the bus operator's supervisor to investigate the reason for the delay(s) this week.

@RideUTA The 830 bus is always late, and never makes it to Provo central in enough time to catch the 5:20 train, which it should. I’m not sure what the issue is but it would be convenient if some change was made to ensure the bus was on time to get to the train.;https://twitter.com/Limeboy17/status/971900834299576320;2018-03-09 00:09:50

Just FYI, the rebrand was determined by the legislature and is not something UTA lobbied for. Service to PV would require riders to transfer trains and isn’t a good use of funds based on ridership.

Also, the UVU stakes are assigned to the Provo Temple, if you volunteer to work in a temple, you are assigned to work in the temple you are assigned to, you cannot pick one based on transportation option so denial of service is a very major issue;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/971199880013144064;2018-03-07 01:44:30

Ten of the 20 YSA stakes are assigned to the Provo Temple as well, and also the UVU stakes. Those students assigned to work in a temple work there too, and with the free passes, a local route (not 811) is mission-critical now, low ridership was a ruse and everyone knows it;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/971194008251740160;2018-03-07 01:21:10
The reason this is important is stake and ward assignments to the Provo Temple, everything NORTH of Provo Center Street is assigned there, not Provo City Center, Orem south of 1600 North is likewise, worker assignments are also by this method.;https://twitter.com/Mackerelcat/status/971193378523107328;2018-03-07 01:18:39

Hi James, spoke to a planner about this. We implemented 811 service to the temple because we didn't have ridership to support all-day service.

Trains will stay at a station for about 30 seconds before departing.

We reviewed the security footage of the Murray platform and it shows the train departed at 4:22:10. That being said, we recommend being at a station 5-7 minutes early. Doors on a train will lock before the train departs so being early ensures you're able to board on time.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/970804102774116352;2018-03-05 23:31:49

Don't blame you, I'd be upset if I saw that, too. However, the operator doesn't have the ability to retract the ramp, it's an automated feature so it sounds like this was a technical mishap. We'll still gladly review this occurence to determine what can be done better next time.;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/970794889540722689;2018-03-05 22:55:12

@RideUTA context: witnessed an elderly woman at the library station try to get the ramp to extend so she could use it, well It didn't even touch the ground before your operator retracted it and closed the doors. Seriously. #livid;https://twitter.com/gigglinggothgrl/status/970792216338751488;2018-03-05 22:44:35

@RideUTA you're canceling the pleasant view front-runner stop? You've only provided stops with TERRIBLE train times / schedules. Who works 15 hour days that can grab the 5 am train and be home on the 7pm? Is it lack of ridership, or just not smart scheduling?

Can you tell us at which station and time this happened, as well as which bus and direction you were trying to take?;https://twitter.com/RideUTA/status/966675914930249728;2018-02-22 14:07:52

Yo thanks for getting there 3 minutes early and leaving 2 minutes and 30 seconds early. Now I have the opportunity to wait an hour in the cold even though I left my class 15 minutes early to catch that train. @RideUTA;https://twitter.com/mattjonin/status/966508933178249216;2018-02-22 03:04:21
